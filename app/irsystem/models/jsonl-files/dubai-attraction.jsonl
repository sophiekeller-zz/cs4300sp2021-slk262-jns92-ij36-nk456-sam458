I was very skeptical at first about whether training with a personal trainer was right for me - now I hate missing sessions and I would go every day if I could. In Symmetry, I found a gym as dedicated to my success as I am and it has become the best part of my day - and the results are amazing. I recommend Symmetry Gym to anyone who is looking to maximize their time and results in the gym!"}, {"language": "en", "rating": 5, "text": "I have always been an active person and have had many personal trainers in the past. Three years ago I got a very bad back injury in the gym and stopped all my exercises. I was even scheduled for surgery which I refused last minute. Having three slipped disks didn&#39;t allow me to go to any gym and train with any trainer. I joined Symmetry gym as they have extensive knowledge about different injuries. What really got me interested to begin with is the fact that the trainers gave me all the same do&#39;s and don&#39;ts as my doctor and physiotherapist. The exercises at the gym are made for me to really strengthen my back while I achieve my goal of losing weight. Also the programs change every few weeks which makes training very interesting. I love Symmetry and because of the attention given to my back I would never change trainers. My trainer is always watching my posture very closely while I do my exercises and changes them immediately when my back starts to slightly hurt. I enjoy working out more than ever before and totally recommend Symmetry to everyone, even those who have serious injuries."}, {"language": "en", "rating": 5, "text": "I am grotesquely underweight for my age and height. I have tried gainers and more gainers and ate ridiculously, and had different shakes that I thought would probably put some weight on me, but alas, my stomach caved in with all these artificial boosters and I let the thought of gaining weight become a distant dream. I play basketball ferociously, I water ski and take vacations to go snowboarding! No. This never helped me put on weight either. My sister (Marzia Ali) found this gym, I don&#39;t know how, but she did and I&#39;m glad she did! She started pushing all these weights (which were posted on Facebook) and when I saw her after 3 months, I was shocked to see how healthy and muscular she was looking! So one fine morning, I landed in Dubai and timidly put my shorts on and followed her to this gym. I never liked going to the gym because I was always surrounded by people who were, well much bigger than me! Symmetry showed me different. Symmetry showed me comfort, and helluva workout customized and catered for me! I don&#39;t live in Dubai and neither do I train with them, but my workout regime comes from Symmetry and the team does frequent follow-ups to make sure maximum juice is obtained! I&#39;ve gained solid 5 kgs up-to date (in less than 3 months), my clothes fit better, my energy on the sports field is phenomenal and I push weights like never before, heck, my litter niece sits on my back while I do pushups! Symmetry doesn&#39;t stop! It&#39;s a machine, it makes you into the person you want to be, and when you think you are there, it&#39;s going to push you even more! Symmetry came, they saw and they conquered. If you want results, this is the place! It is your personal gym! It is your family!"}, {"language": "en", "rating": 5, "text": "I recently joined Symmetry Gym having tried and tested most fitness programmes in Dubai without any lasting success... From the moment I walked into Symmetry Gym for my consultation, I knew I had found somewhere special and I have felt part of the &quot;team&quot; from day one. I happily make my 6:30am sessions with my awesome trainer Dave... and actually look forward to my work outs... in a couple of weeks I have seen massive improvements in my strength and I can&#39;t wait to see what a couple of months and more will do for my body and health following the Symmetry Gym programme. At one gym, there is just so much knowledge, enthusiasm and encouragement - I would challenge anyone not to become addicted to this place and definitely encourage you to join... it will be AEDs well spent for sure!!"}, {"language": "en", "rating": 5, "text": "A truly unique training studio. This is far different than any other studio in Dubai, and nothing like a big box gym. A friend invited me to an open house. I came into it skeptical and wondered what all the buzz was about. and after sampling a workout, I knew these programs were something different and special. I signed up for Amir&#39;s online coaching program the very next day, and now, wish I would have done this a long time ago. See, I was already fairly lean and fit when I came to Symmetry. I am a personal trainer, was an All-state track athlete in my teens, and even competed on a national level in physique competitions. In the past 2 months, following Amir&#39;s unique program design, I have taken my fitness capacity to an entirely new level, and have seen changes in my body I have not seen before, when following my own workout design. The gym itself not stuffy or snobby. The trainers are friendly and helpful, and it&#39;s a fun environment, but everybody means business. You will be pushed to your maximum capability. You will also get sane nutritional guidance that works, not starvation diet recommendations. The studio is so clean, you could eat off the floor--something you rarely see in a gym. To summarize, best program design, guaranteed results, and excellent staff. This the place you go to if you want to change."}]}
